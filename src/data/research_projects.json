    "description": "ColorMod is a method to create 3D objects that allow for multi-color changes in their appearance even after fabrication. It works by placing differently colored photochromic materials in a dense multi-color voxel pattern across the entire surface of the object (see Figure 3). During recoloring, only the voxels with the desired color are activated; all other voxels remain deactivated and transparent."
