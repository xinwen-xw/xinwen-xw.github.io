    "description": "This paper presents a computational fabrication technique to generate dissolvable interfaces between different materials in a 3D printed object without affecting the objectâ€™s intended use. When the interfaces are dissolved, the object is disassembled to enable recycling of the individual materials."

    "description": "The Biofibers Spinning Machine produces bio-based fibers (biofibers) that are dissolvable and biodegradable. These fibers enable recycling of smart textiles by making it easy to separate electronics from textiles. Currently, prototyping with the machine requires the use of low-level commands, i.e. G-code. To enable more people to participate in the sustainable smart textiles design space and develop new biofiber materials, we need to provide accessible tools and workflows. This work explores a software tool that facilitates material exploration with machine parameters. "

    "description": "ColorMod is a method to create 3D objects that allow for multi-color changes in their appearance after fabrication. It works by placing differently colored photochromic materials in a dense multi-color voxel pattern across the entire surface of the object. During recoloring, only the voxels with the desired color are activated; all other voxels remain deactivated and transparent."
